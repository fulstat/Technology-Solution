# Technology Solution Library 
__Series in Technology Research. Creative based on profitable demand in development, innovation in the life and industry sectors__

__Respect for Nature - Respect for Truth- Respect for Human__

List of ebook, source code, projects, processing huge data, foundation in computer science, open source, science research in the technology area. The first elementary in science research that should clearly realize and certainly understand origin of the phenomenon from tiny independence physical properties and details to combination in real object in the life before intent to any theory research. 

The following list below that genre of the technological ebook include:
